# Test-MachEight
The task is to create an application that takes a single integer input. The application will download the JSON raw data from the website (https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com) and print a list of all pairs of players whose height in inches adds up to the integer input to the application. If no matches are found, the application will print "No matches found"

I used SpringBoot framework and Gradle to create and build the project.

*Note: In order to run the Application, at least Java 11 must be installed in your system.*

## Steps to run
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run in terminal './gradlew build'
3. Run in terminal 'java -jar ./build/libs/test-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar'
